# [ networks by jvmi ]

a collective art experience collaborating to build a digital 3d sculpture inspired by ethereum.

## What is this?

this interface is a **sandbox environment** — a place to play with the visual language of _networks_.

- a **node** is a 5×5 grid of colorful circles.
- multiple nodes come together to form a **block**, a rotating 3d sculpture.

inside the sandbox, you can:

- click circles to change their colors
- swap between different color palettes to see new variations
- rotate blocks in 3d space and watch them animate
- take a photo or choose one from your camera roll to generate a custom node
- save or share your creations with others

these experiments are a preview of the process that will eventually generate the final 2d and 3d artworks known as **nodes** and **blocks**. it’s a space for curiosity, play, and exploration before the full project release.
